# FAQs

**What if some of the people don't meet all the points?**

That is very normal, people are usually stronger in some areas and weaker in others. The framework should not be used as a checklist to promote people but instead as guidance to have meaningful career conversations.

**When is a person ready to move to the next level?**

Companies usually expect a person to be performing at the next level _consistently for several months_ before formalizing a promotion.

**How do I collect evidence to support the discussion with my direct reports?**

Different teams collect evidence in different ways. A recommended approach is to use a combination of:

- Feedback from peers and other teams
- Self-evaluation
