The chart shown above has the following 5 axes:

- **Technology**: knowledge of the tech stack and tools
- **System**: level of ownership of the system(s)
- **People**: relationship with the team(s)
- **Process**: level of engagement with the development process
- **Influence**: scope of influence of the position

The **influence** axis can be seen as a _different dimension_ since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.
